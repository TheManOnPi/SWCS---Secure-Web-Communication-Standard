# SWCS (Secure Web Communication Standard) - Protocol Overview
#
# Purpose:
# - SWCS is a next-generation communication standard designed to replace or augment HTTP/HTTPS.
# - Provides a secure, ad-free, and user-focused foundation for modern web interaction.
# - Builds trust by integrating safety, integrity, and resilience into the protocol layer itself.
#
# Core Principles:
# - Privacy-first: no hidden tracking, data harvesting, or intrusive ads.
# - Integrity-verified: all content is validated to prevent tampering or injection.
# - Resilient-by-design: the network remains functional even under outages or attacks.
# - Safety-centric: protects users against harmful, malicious, or exploitative material.
#
# Core Features:
# - Uses WAS (Web Addressing Service) for domain resolution, filtering, and safety rules.
# - Mesh-network architecture ensures no single point of failure.
# - Encrypted CloudLink/WebSockets provide secure peer-to-peer synchronization.
# - Central rule store (WAS Bank) with mirror support ensures consistent policies network-wide.
# - Automatic synchronization of bans, rules, and context analyzer updates.
# - Integrity checks via hashes and CMD (Content Modification Detection) on all delivered content.
#
# User Safety Mechanisms:
# - Harmful/self-harm “how-to” websites permanently banned at protocol level.
# - Pornographic or unsafe sites blocked automatically when Kid Safe Mode is enabled.
# - Context analyzers built into SWCS detect toxic or malicious payloads in real time.
# - Toxic/fake news links are flagged or blocked to preserve quality of information.
# - Self-harm content redirects users to support resources or mental health helplines.
# - Legitimate helplines and neutral resources are always accessible (whitelisted).
#
# Network Operation:
# - Decentralized browsing with central synchronization (via WAS Bank and mirrors).
# - Nodes continuously monitored for uptime and reliability; compromised nodes flagged.
# - Random external site fetches provide proactive malware detection and viral disruption.
# - Caching mechanisms allow offline resilience until sync is restored.
#
# Extensions:
# - WAS-SBB enables device-to-device data sharing via Bluetooth inside SWCS.
# - Organizations (e.g., schools, enterprises) can extend SWCS with local WAS Bank mirrors.
# - Optional version control allows rollback of rules in case of false positives.
#
# Philosophy:
# - SWCS defines a safer, cleaner, and more reliable replacement for the modern web.
# - Eliminates manipulative business models (ads, trackers, spam) at the protocol level.
# - Represents a paradigm shift: communication standards that actively protect users.


# WAS (Web Addressing Service) - for SWCS (Secure Web Communication Standard)
#
# Core Design:
# - WAS is a secure addressing and browsing layer for the web under the SWCS protocol.
# - Operates as a mesh network using CloudLink/WebSockets for node-to-node communication.
# - Nodes (WAS instances) share responsibility; if one goes offline, others seamlessly take over.
# - Central database called WAS Bank provides the source of truth for rules, bans, and flags.
# - Mirrors of WAS Bank may be hosted by organizations or individuals for redundancy and local policy.
# - All nodes automatically sync with WAS Bank or its mirrors to stay up to date.
#
# Security & Integrity:
# - CMD (Content Modification Detection) validates all served content and blocks tampering attempts.
# - Context analyzers scan HTML and linked resources for malicious or harmful payloads.
# - WAS nodes run uptime monitors; compromised or unreliable nodes are flagged or disconnected.
# - Nodes periodically fetch random site HTML to disrupt virus targeting and provide broad scanning.
# - GitHub integration supplies official rule updates, ban lists, and context analyzer improvements.
# - All sync and update traffic is hashed/verified for authenticity before execution.
#
# User Protection:
# - Kid Safe Mode blocks pornographic sites and permanently bans suicide “how-to” domains.
# - Harmful self-harm content redirects users to supportive or positive resources.
# - Helplines and legitimate support sites are always whitelisted.
# - Toxic or suspicious links trigger an "Are you sure?" prompt before navigation.
# - Fake news domains are flagged or blocked to prevent misinformation spread.
# - Entire WAS ecosystem is ad-free: no sponsored content, no trackers, no injected ads.
#
# Network Behavior:
# - Decentralized operation with centralized consistency via WAS Bank synchronization.
# - WAS Bank mirrors support custom extensions for local rules (schools, businesses, etc).
# - Version control of bans/rules allows rollback if false positives occur.
# - Offline nodes can catch up using local cache until sync is restored.
# - Resilient mesh design ensures continuous protection even under partial network outages.
#
# Purpose:
# - WAS + SWCS aim to redefine web access: secure, safe, reliable, and user-first.
# - Vision: a resilient addressing service that protects against malicious content,
#   misinformation, harmful material, and toxic links by design.
# - Philosophy: WAS is a clean replacement for today’s unsafe, ad-driven, and exploit-prone web.
